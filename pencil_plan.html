							<h2>Overview:</h2>
							<p>The Providing Educational Necessities for Children in Learning (PENCIL) Plan is a project that is especially special to me. With the PENCIL Plan, I organized a team of 18 people that collected donations for Title 1 Elementary Schools. Together, we successfully raised over $2,900 in cash and check donations and over $1,500 in supply donations that we gave to Porter Elementary. Since its creation, I have continued the PENCIL Plan throughout 2020 and remain in contact with this year’s organizers on how to plan fundraising events for the PENCIL Plan. I can say with complete confidence that planning a project from scratch to help my community has been one of the most satisfying and proudest moments of my life knowing that I helped  give back to my community, even if it only made a small difference. Part of the inspiration I had for creating the PENCIL Plan was due to the lack of funding for public schools. Of the 55 elementary schools in my hometown’s Mesa Public Schools (MPS) district, 44 of them are considered Title 1 schools. Title 1 schools are schools where at least 40% of the students are considered low-income. In 2017, parents spent an average of $500 on school supplies. For a low-income family, this can be a financial burden, and that is why I created the PENCIL Plan. Furthermore, Arizona is one of the lowest ranked states in education, and I have always felt compelled to give back to my community so that it may grow in opportunities for future students.</p>
							<p>As the leader of the PENCIL Plan, I managed of team of 15-20 people to help collect donations and oversee the PENCIL Plan Charity Concert. The PENCIL Plan logo and all printed materials to send to students, performers, teachers, and sponsors were created from scratch. Since the setting of this organization was schools and was entirely run by students, I aimed to make the PENCIL Plan visual identify represent a yellow pencil: a classic image all students are familiar with. Thus, I chose to create images reflect the aesthetic of a typical American public school.</p>

							<h2>Brand Goals:</h2>
							<p><img src="img/icons/heart_hands.png" alt="" width="40px"><b>Service and Community</b>
								<br>
								Every single person that helps with organizing the PENCIL Plan is a volunteer. Without recognizing the importance of serving one’s community, the PENCIL Plan would not exist and thus, the PENCIL Plan places a great importance on helping others on of duty and compassion.</p>
							<p><img src="img/icons/teamwork.png" alt="" width="40px"><b>Teamwork and Communication</b>
								<br>The PENCIL Plan collaborated with churches, elementary schools, middle schools, high schools, company sponsors, and the school administration. It was crucial that all volunteers and leaders communicated clearly to retain professionalism and understand what stage each group was at.</p>
